# Combat Modifiers
Any circumstance or environment that may expand or restrict the actions the participants are incentivized to take, or can take at all.

1. Players *are* incentivized to destroy the portal to hell, but *can* still fight the demons pouring through.
2. Players *must* extinguish the candles in order to make the ghost corporeal.
3. Players *cannot* leave the forcefield until the wizard is killed or interrupted.
4. Players *can* shoot a chandelier from the ceiling to drop it onto their foes.

## Possible Representations
Rules cards the GM puts in place during the encounter, which may or may not be hidden depending on player knowledge.

Object cards (chandelier) that have no front-facing rules text, but that the players may interact with creatively.

## Concerns
How do we avoid environmental items (chandeliers etc.) becoming signposts of a "right" way to do the fight?

How do we encourage use of these in ways that are in line with how we intend them to be used?

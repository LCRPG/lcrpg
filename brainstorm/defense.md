# Defense

## Roll to defend
When attacked, a character can attempt to dodge or power through the hit. In doing so, they'll flip a number of cards and select a number
of cards, then use the resulting sum to attempt to mitigate the attack.

The number of cards that are flipped and selected can be modified by a character's inbuilt traits. For example, a monk-style character
may get to look at more cards or select more cards when attempting to dodge.

## Hit / Miss + Wounds
When a character is hit with an attack or other damaging effect, they take a wound. Specific effects may have modifiers that inflict
additional wounds.

Characters have a static target number of wounds that, if met or exceeded, they fall unconscious / die / otherwise go down.

Players need to generate a number that meets or exceeds a static target to have an effect on an enemy.

Players need to generate a number that meets or exceeds a static target to avoid the effects of attacks or spells. (Inter-player combat?
How do we deal with ties?)

## Type Resistance / Immunity
Characters can have resistance / immunity that reduces the number of wounds they take from a given damage type, or nullifies the damage
entirely.

## Weakness
Characters can have weakness to a specific damage type that results in them taking an additional wound when given a wound by that
damage type.

# Critical Hits
Critical Hits can occur when a player generates an attacking number in excess of a Critical Threshold. Critical Thresholds can be defined
at an engine-level as a additive / multiple on Armor Class. Critical Thresholds can also be defined in a character-specific context.

Traits, individual effects, or damage types may grant additional options for a Critical Effect. The default effect applies an additional
wound. When an effect lands a Critical Hit, the character dealing the Critical Hit selects one of the available effects to apply to the
target.

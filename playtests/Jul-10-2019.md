## Basic Info

First playtest with Hex Grid

- Num. Players: 3
Clay: Shaman, Wizard
John: Rogue
Cole: Paladin

## General Observations

- grid based is more expressive than rank based, but unclear if it is worth it because of complexity
- energy felt generally good, harder to balance
- numbers are fucked
- action economy is fucked
- card flipping is complex to determine "how" to flip

## Needs more testing


## What Worked?

## What Didn't Work?

- templating on dodging

## Ideas

- TEMPLATING HARD
- movement speed (encumberence)
- flat footed ideas
- moving through allies?
- attacks of opportunity
- reactions, potentially distinct from AOO
- engagement mechanics for AOO, possibly from shields
- held actions/turns
- Minor attack on weapons interaction with energy mechanics
- Perception?
- terrain rules?
- adding character sheet numbers is being forgotten
- moving 1 square is the same energy as 6 squares
- inititive from card in hand
- adding movement to cards
- representing status on minis is harder
- should the enemies be on the energy system?
- splitting movement
- levels as xp breakpoints unlocking feats/free cards
- "distance" for combat

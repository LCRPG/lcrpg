# Playtest Report Survey

## Basic Info

- Num. Players: 4
Clay: Wizard
John: Ranger
Cole: Priest
Riley: Warrior

## General Observations

- increase monster initiative
- shuffling with alchemy effects
- maybe too much math?
- should stats on characters be there?
- cards in other peoples deck + sleeves?
- label the stats
- monsters need stats if we want contests
- what word to use for "roll/flip"
- pay energy to draw a card?

## Needs more testing

- move stats to other side of the card

## What Worked?

- No character sheet modifiers was better
- adding modifiers is better than multipling modifiers
Riley
- Loop was basically good, each turn was active, and decisions were important
- Lacking deck manipulation for when you care about more specific cards
- defense felt weird
- offense felt good and clean
- augment was missed

## What Didn't Work?

- Cross party synergy wasn't apparent, and this should be explored

## Ideas
